THIS BOOST IS NO LONGER BEING UPDATED! PLEASE USE [AMAZING YOUTUBE 2.0](https://github.com/anthonydu/arc-boosts/tree/dc2a3c8efab7a2c8b3d67e5f1175bc431767a4de/Amazing%20YouTube%202.0) INSTEAD.

This Boost simplifies YouTube's user interface by removing various components that I consider to be eyesores and useless through CSS while also adding additional nice-to-have functionalities to the site through Javascript. Feel free to experiment and customize your experience after installation. Works with YouTube's latest UI as of the most recent update date.

## List of UI elements removed (CSS)
### Across YouTube
- Scrollbar
- Shorts, Originals, YouTube Music, Your clips, and Your videos buttons from the sidebar
- Subscriptions, More from YouTube sections from the sidebar
- Voice search and create button from the header

### Home page
- Suggested filters below the header
- All shelves in home page suggestions (Shorts, etc.)

### Watch page
- Annotation
- Suggested filters above the up next column
- Text labels from buttons in the video details section (side effect: flexible items that were usually hidden will now have space to show up, i.e. download and save)
- Clip and super thanks buttons removed from video details section

## Added functionalities (CSS)
- Theater mode player will always be 16:9 (off by default)
- Replaces mini-player button with picture-in-picture (which YouTube has built-in but does not display for some reason)

## Added functionalities (JS)
- Prevents autoplay (off by default)
- Forces theater mode since that's my favorite way to watch videos
- Turns off up next autoplay and removes the toggle from player controls
